ueb-thesis-latex
================

Unofficial (yet useful) LaTeX templates for writing PhD thesis according to ueb.eu requirements.

This project aims at providing code which is both *simple* (as in "It took me 5 minutes to make it work!") and *portable* (as in "I use XeTeX and Memoir to write my thesis, and generating the right cover simply consisted in 2 or 3 tweaks.").

We plan to reach this goal by:
* providing only vital files to fulfill administration requirements;
* removing any complicated stuff contained in old templates;
* writing a short and clear documentation;
* making the things easily customizable.


For now, the source tree only contains cover macros for INSA Rennes, but it can be completed and updated easily.

**Feel free to ask for becoming a collaborator on this project.**
